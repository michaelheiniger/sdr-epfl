    % Nicolae: extended from (-2:1:2)
    deltaTau = (-10:1:10); % we search several points around the current tau
    
    newTau = adjustTau(sat_number, tau, deltaTau, doppler);
    
    % Now deal with the Doppler:
    % The idea is to compute the inneer product at three points, namely at the
    % current Doppler estimate as well as fCorr Hz before and fCorr Hz
    % after. We know (from experiments) that the top of the curve that plots
    % the absolute value of the inner product as a function of the Doppler can
    % be approximated by a second degree polynomial of the form ax^2+bx+c.
    % Hence we find the coefficients of the second degree polynomial that goes
    % through the calculated points. The value of x that corresponds to the
    % maximum is then -b/(2a). 

    fCorr = 20;
    newDoppler = adjustDoppler(sat_number, newTau, doppler, fCorr);
