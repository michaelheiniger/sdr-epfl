% READ_2PART_UNSIGNED Extracts data from a page when the data is stored in two different locations
% X = READ_2PART_UNSIGNED(P, SF, AM, NM, AL, NL, S)
% Arguments:
%   P   Page (P is a 300x5 matrix of bits {0,1})
%   SF  Subframe ID
%   AM  Starting bit (MSB part)
%   NM  Number of bits (MSB part)
%   AL  Starting bit (LSB part)
%   NL  Number of bits (LSB part)
%   S   Exponent of scaling factor (factor = 2^S)
%
%   X = m * 2^S, where m is the mantissa represented by the two chunks of bits (expressed in base 10)
